### **NumPy Basics**
1. Create a 1D NumPy array with numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Create a 2D NumPy array of shape (3, 3) with all elements as 1.
3. Create a 3D NumPy array of shape (2, 2, 2) with all elements as 5.
4. Create a NumPy array with 10 equally spaced values between 0 and 1.
5. Create a NumPy array with random integers between 1 and 100 of shape (5, 5).
